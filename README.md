description of project:A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet
project setup instructions
- follow the "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow.
-you'll want to create a test file to test the functionality of the ceaser cipher.
-you will need to test out if the entered input is appropriate
-reate an encoding class that takes an input and encrypts it using the desired key of your choice
-create a decoding class that converts the output that was produced by the encoding class and returns the original value or input that was fed earlier
-all the classes should be encapsulated containing private properties
-when your logic for encrypting and decrypting a String input (and well-tested), work on displaying the encrypted and decrypted data.
